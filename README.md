StatusHSMTY
===========


This is an Objective-C project I made when I was a member of Hackerspace Monterrey. This is basically a client that consumes services that follows the Space API specification. This is a specification designed to share certain information of the hackerspaces like state, events, contact information, the status of the space (open/closed), etc.  

The last update was done some months before iOS 7 was released, so probably the project doesn't work anymore.
