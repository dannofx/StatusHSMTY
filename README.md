# :warning: This project has not received maintenance in some years and probably it doesn't work anymore. :warning:

This is an Objective-C project I made when I was a member of Hackerspace Monterrey. This is basically a client that consumes services that follows the Space API specification. This is a specification designed to share certain information of the hackerspaces like state, events, contact information, the status of the space (open/closed), etc.
I'm not intended to maintain this project anymore.
